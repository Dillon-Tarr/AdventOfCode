rx must receive one low pulse.
ULTIMATE CONDITION: One parent of rx sends a LOW pulse -> Success

We need to capture all top-level conditions.
Top-level conditions are conditions which must be checked.
How many generations up can we check?

*0G*
rx - must receive 1 low

If we just check if rx receives a low pulse on every cycle, we will be checking eternally. This will not work.
The higher up the generation chain we can check, the more efficient this will be.
There is but one problem. We can't just check one condition high up the chain.
We must determine a list of conditions as high up the chain as possible, make sure they are accurate,
    and then check how often each of them occur. If they occur repeatedly, then we can get the LCM
    of all the necessary and accurate conditions to find when rx would receive 1 low pulse.

*1G*
Frx - must send low (will send low after receiving 2 low pulses)
Crx - must send low (will send low after most-recently receiving a high pulse from all parents)

For Crx, we must simply check that every parent of Crx last sent high.
    For each parent of Crx, if it is a C module, we must check that it has exactly one parent that last sent low.
    If a parent of Crx is an F module, we must check that that parent has received an odd number of low pulses.

*2G*
FFrx - must send low (will send low after receiving 2 low pulses)
CFrx - must send low (will send low after most-recently receiving a high pulse from all parents)
FCrx - must send high (will send high after receiving 1 low pulse)
CCrx - must send high (will send high after receiving any pulse if not all parents have most recently sent high)

*3G*
FFFrx - must send low (will send low after receiving 2 low pulses)
CFFrx - must send low (will send low after most-recently receiving a high pulse from all parents)
FCFrx - must send high (will send high after receiving 1 low pulse)
CCFrx - must send high (will send high after receiving any pulse if not all parents have most recently sent high)
FFCrx - must send low (will send low after receiving 2 low pulses)
CFCrx - must send low (will send low after most-recently receiving a high pulse from all parents)
FCCrx - ONE must send low (will send low after receiving 2 low pulses)
CCCrx - ONE must send low (will send low after most-recently receiving a high pulse from all parents)



1-generation-above-rx:
    For each parent of rx:
        If rx-parent (1 generation above rx) is a CONJUNCTION module, the last pulse from each of its parents must be HIGH.
            Find how often each 2G parent of 1G Conjunction Module sends HIGH. When all do -> SUCCESS
            If all parents of such a module are FLIP-FLOP modules, then each of those FLIP
        If rx-parent (1 generation above rx) is a FLIP-FLIP module, it will send a HIGH pulse after it receives one LOW pulse.
            After it receives a SECOND LOW pulse, it too will send a LOW pulse -> SUCCESS

2-generations-above-rx:
    For each 1G CONJUNCTION:
        Each 2G CONJUNCTION parent must send a high pulse. Therefore ONE or more 3G parent must send LOW.
        Each 2G FLIP-FLOP parent must send a high pulse. Since these flip-flop, they must be checked from
            ...the perspective of the 1G CONJUNCTION child to ALL send HIGH.
