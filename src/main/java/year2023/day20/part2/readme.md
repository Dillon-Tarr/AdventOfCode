The notes files in this directory are from before and after a project interrupted my work in this puzzle. I had been intent on writing up code that would handle all the possible genealogies above the rx module.

I have since decided that is currently far to great a task for me to spend the required time to accomplish. I instead wrote a solution which would get the answer right now.

Since the problem is a highly specific one that I do not anticipate repeatedly running into (and even if it were, much work would need to be re-done anyway for such a strange problem), I do not at all feel bad about this. In fact, I feel mostly relief.

If it appears some of the code in the solution is irrelevant to the way I ended up solving the problem, that's because it is. Particularly I'm referring to tracking generations above rx. This was not used in the solution, because I knew from what I had previously noted about my puzzle input exactly what conditions I needed to look for.

Maybe I will refactor this at some point, but now is not that point.
