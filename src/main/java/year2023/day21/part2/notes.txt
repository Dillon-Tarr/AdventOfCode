Start point is in the exact center (65, 65) (indexed 0-130) on a 131x131 grid.

It takes exactly 131 steps to reach every reachable tile on the original grid from the center.
It also takes exactly 131 steps to go from the center of a grid to the center of any horizontally or vertically adjacent grid.
It takes 65 steps to exactly reach any one edge of the original grid from the center.
It takes 66 steps to land on the edge of an adjacent grid from the center.
It takes 66+66 (132) steps to land on the corner of a diagonally adjacent grid from the center.

Required steps for part 2: 26501365
26501365/131 == 202300r65

Most repeated grids will be completely filled with alternating parity.

Shorthand for stepCount/gridWidth (floor division): gridWidthStepCounts
    Total number of grids will be:
        Full grids with odd parity: ((((gridWidthStepCounts-1)/2)*2)+1)^2 : 1, 1, 9, 9, 25, etc.
        Full grids with even parity: ((gridWidthStepCounts/2)*2)^2 : 0, 4, 4, 16, 16, 36, etc.
        One grid entered from center-left with 130 steps remaining.
        One grid entered from center-top with 130 steps remaining.
        One grid entered from center-right with 130 steps remaining.
        One grid entered from center-bottom with 130 steps remaining.
        Grids entered from sw corner with 64 steps remaining: gridWidthStepCounts
        Grids entered from nw corner with 64 steps remaining: gridWidthStepCounts
        Grids entered from ne corner with 64 steps remaining: gridWidthStepCounts
        Grids entered from se corner with 64 steps remaining: gridWidthStepCounts
