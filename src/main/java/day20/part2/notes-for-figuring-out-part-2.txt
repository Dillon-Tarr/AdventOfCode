All the parents of these four modules are FlipFlop modules.
We must find out how often they send the required high pulse and find the LCM of all of them.

&qq
&fj
&jc
&vm
// Each of these modules is the single parent of the next 4 modules below.
// Each needs to send a low pulse.
// Therefore, the inputs from each of these modules' parents must be high all simultaneously.

->

&ft,
&jz,
&sv,
&ng
// All of these must send a high pulse.
// Condition: At least one of the parents of each must send a low pulse.
// Since the parents of these modules are single parents, each parent needs to send a low pulse.

-> &xm
// Must send a low pulse.
//Condition: All parents send high pulse.

-> rx
//Must receive a low pulse.
// Condition: Parent sends low pulse.

Check input modules of rx. We must find out when any one of them sends one low pulse.
For each module, if instanceof ConjunctionModule:
  check input modules of ConjunctionModule.
For each ConjunctionModule encountered, add it to those to check if it has no ConjunctionModuleParents.
Otherwise, go to each of its ConjunctionModule parents and repeat.
Find how frequently the uppermost ConjunctionModules send a high pulse.
Get LCM of these periods.
